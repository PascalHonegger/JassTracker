% The following command indicates that its content consists of instructions
% Even if it does not do anything, it is still a good idea to keep instructions within the `instruction` tag to separate them from the rest of the text. One could then typeset them differently, or choose to remove them form the document by redefining the command definition 
\newcommand{\instructions}[1]{#1}

% Uncomment the following command to remove all instructions
% \newcommand{\instructions}[1]{}

% Uncomment the following to make instructions appear in coloured boxes
% Note: The changes within `\instruciton` are not visible in latexdiff when they are typeset in this way
