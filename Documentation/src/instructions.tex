\chapter*{Instructions for using this template}

\instructions{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The main aim of this document template is to allow you to start working on your project documentation as quickly as possible.
        \item In addition to recommending a rough structure for your project documentation, this template also contains instructions related to the content and execution your project. Instructional text is typeset within the \LaTeX\ \texttt{instructions} command defined in \texttt{custom.tex}. Make sure that your final submission does not contain any instructional texts.
        \item The basic defaults that \LaTeX\ provides have been used whenever possible in order to keep the template as simple as possible for beginners. One can do better. \LaTeX\ also provides additional features such as glossaries, abbreviation lists and indexes that you may find useful. Feel free to customise the typesetting and content of this document as per your requirements, tastes and wishes as you progress with the project.
        \item Here is an example of a bibliography reference: \cite{larman_applyingUmlAndPatterns_2004}
