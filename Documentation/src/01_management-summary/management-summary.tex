\chapter*{Management Summary}

\instructions{
    Even though this is the first chapter of your document, it is typically the last one filled with content. The \textit{Management Summary} is a \textbf{brief and high-level summary} of your project. It should give any reader unfamiliar to the project an overview of the contents included later in the document.
    
    \bigskip
    
    A common structure is:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the problem we wanted to solve?
        \item How did we solve the problem?
        \item Does your solution solve the problem in a successful way?
        \item Will there be consecutive projects based on your work?
    \end{itemize}
    
    Diagrams and images work very well in this chapter, especially screenshots of your software.
    
    \bigskip
    
    One final remark: a well written management summary is a good starting point for your \textbf{Project Presentation}, as you will address a similar audience there.
