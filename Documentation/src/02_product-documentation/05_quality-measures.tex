\chapter{Quality Measures}

\section{Working with Git}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We use conventional commits
    \item We use Merge Requests in GitLab, direct pushes to master are forbidden
    \item We rebase our commits locally and create a merge commit when merging into master
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition of Done (DoD)}

\subsection{Feature (Defect / Story)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acceptance criteria / issue of user story is met
    \item Code follows best practices and guidelines
    \item No TODOs without an issue number are allowed
    \item Project builds without errors or warnings
    \item Tests are written and all tests are passing
    \item Peer Code Review performed
    \item Project deployed on the test environment identical to the production platform
    \item Documentation updated
    \item Associated with epic and release
    \item Hours worked on are logged correctly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item DoD of each item included in the sprint is met
    \item Product backlog updated
    \item Sprint has a defined goal
    \item Sprint marked as ready for the production deployment by the Product Owner
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Release}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Release is documented and all continuing tasks are associated
    \item Code complete
    \item Environments are prepared for release
    \item QA is done \& all issues resolved
    \item Manual tests pass
    \item Check that no unfinished work has been left in any development or staging environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition of Ready (DoR)}

\subsection{Defect}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Steps to reproduce
    \item Severity
    \item Screenshots
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use-Case (e.g.\ view current score)
    \item Estimate
    \item Epic link
    \item Acceptance criteria list specified
    \item Should be doable within a week, otherwise try to split it
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Concept}
\subsection{Unit Tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Business Logic will be unit tested
    \item Runs on every push to GitLab, merging is blocked until failing tests are fixed
    \item Automated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration Tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Framework / technology dependent code will be integration tested
    \item Runs on every push to GitLab, merging is blocked until failing tests are fixed
    \item The web API layer is tested by using \href{https://ktor.io/docs/testing.html}{Ktor testing}, allowing us to verify our REST endpoints
    \item The data access layer is tested by using \href{https://www.testcontainers.org/}{Testcontainers}, allowing us to use a real PostgreSQL DB in our tests
    \item Automated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability Tests (See Chapter~\ref{ch:uxtesting})}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Project will be given to multiple people for testing (hallway testing)
    \item Testers should be able to use website without having to ask any questions
    \item Manual
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How full System works together - how components interact
    \item Influenced by usability testing
    \item Manual
    \item \href{https://www.cypress.io}{Cypress} was evaluated for automated end-to-end testing, but we came to the conclusion that our time is better invested in manual usability testing and actually improving our app.
\end{itemize}

\section{Continuous Integration and Deployment}
We use GitLab for continuous integration and have a pipeline which runs on every commit and builds both frontend and backend.
For the backend, tests are run and a linter for the frontend.
If all jobs succeed, a Docker image is built, pushed to the registry and tagged with the current branch name.
Once a merge request is merged into the master branch the pipeline is run again and a Docker image tagged with latest is built.
If that succeeds the new image is automatically deployed to our staging environment with the option to deploy to production with a single click in GitLab.
See also~\nameref{sec:architecture_deployment}.

\section{Code Quality Tools}
We have chosen to integrate the following code quality tools to ensure proper achievement of the following NFRs (See Chapter~\ref{sec:NFR}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item NFR-13: Code Base Understanding
    \item NFR-14: Test-Coverage
    \item NFR-16: Lighthouse categories are acceptable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Qodana}
To ensure the integrity of our code we have integrated Qodana into our CI pipeline.
We decided to use Qodana instead of Sonar to avoid the problem of self-hosting.
Other reasons we decided Qodana was a reasonable choice are the easy integration into our CI pipeline and IntelliJ and also qodana works well with all our other used technologies.
For our Backend, we have the Qodana JVM linter, which statically analyzes our Backend (Kotlin \& Java) code.
Concretely, code smells, potential bugs, dead code and general improvements in the overall code structure are reported.
For our Frontend (Vue \& TypeScript), we use Qodana JS, which is based on Webstorm's linters.

\subsection{Lighthouse}
We have also integrated \href{https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci}{Lighthouse CI} to get a performance overview.
We decided on Lighthouse CI because it's established in the industry and provides an in depth analysis.
A single Lighthouse report provides a snapshot of a web page's performance at the time that it is run.
Failing sections of the Lighthouse report indicate where improvements should be made.

\subsection{Kover}
To be able to test our Test-Coverage of 80\% we integrated \href{https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover}{Kover}.
Because Kover is a Gradle plugin for native Kotlin code coverage, it encouraged us to use it based on its easy setup.
It's important to note that Kover is still in its incubator phase, however multiple reviews have shown promising results, which is why we decided it was fitting for our Kotlin setup.
We have integrated a job in our CI pipeline that fails if the code coverage doesn't reach our specified minimum and provides a Kover Code Coverage Report, showing where the coverage needs to be improved.
