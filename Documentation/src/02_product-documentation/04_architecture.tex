\chapter{Architecture}

\section{System Context}
We have a single \emph{JassTracker} system without any external services.

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{resources/diagrams/c4-1-system-context}

\section{Container}
Our system is split into three containers.
Each container uses its own technology and could be (relatively) easily exchanged.

The \emph{Frontend} is our single-page-application which provides the user interface.
We decided to use a dedicated SPA instead of server rendered pages to improve the user experience.
When a user enters a score, only a small fraction of the whole page needs to be updated.
We can also stay more flexible with a dedicated SPA, for example we could implement an offline mode in the future.

The \emph{Backend} provides multiple REST-API-Endpoints which will be used by the \emph{Frontend}.
All business logic will be implemented and tested here, providing preprocessed and easy to digest data upon request.
Having a public REST-API enforces a clean separation and makes testing early on easier.

The \emph{Database} is a simple PostgreSQL database used to store our data.
It is part of the JassTracker system, therefore it gets set-up, deployed and migrated in conjunction with the other components.
This approach lets us easily manage multiple instances of the same system without having to manually keep databases up to date.

\section{Components}

\subsection{Frontend}
The frontend is a single-page-application written in Vue3 and TypeScript.
We use Vue \emph{Single-File Components}, keeping all relevant parts of a component in a single file.
TypeScript ensures more issues are caught at compile time, reducing testing overhead.

\subsubsection*{Store}
We use \href{https://pinia.vuejs.org/}{Pinia} as a state store, which is the modern default for Vue3.
Using a central state was a deliberate decision to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
We can have most of the business logic in a central, testable and re-usable place.
Pinia also provides a great developer experience for understanding the current state of the application.

\subsubsection*{Views}
Every route (e.g. \emph{/overview}, \emph{/profile}) is implemented as a view.
These views are responsible for tying together different components and the state store.
Relevant data is requested from the store and provided to components.

\subsubsection*{Components}
Whenever any piece of UI code wants to be re-used, it's put in a component.
These components are then used across many views, without ever knowing which views it's being used in.
A component has simple input and output using Vue mechanics, which make them flexible.
This separation ensures components can be re-used without requiring refactoring first.

\subsubsection*{Services}
Services provide a small abstraction layer to the backend.
The services are strictly typed, which enables frontend developers to write code without having to look at the backend api definition.
The \href{https://github.com/posva/mande}{mande} dependency is very simple, which facilitates the creation of services.

\subsection{Backend}
The backend is structured into circular layers, following the clean-architecture principle.
This means that the \emph{Domain} is in the center, being responsible for all business logic.
Technology-dependent logic is extracted to an outer layer, ensuring they could be easily changed in the future.

\subsubsection*{Bootstrap}
The bootstrap module was created as an entry point to the backend.
It reads the configuration file, configures the web server and initializes all modules.
This module is the least testable and depends on everything else, that's why as little logic as possible is stored here.
Still, one key part of the Bootstrap module is configuring Ktor, we decided that a dedicated module for Ktor configuration would provide little benefit.

\subsubsection*{Security}
The security module is our smallest module, but it's still essential.
Password hashing and JWT configuration is done within this module to abstract any security related dependencies.
If anything cryptography-related wasn't correct, this would be the place to fix it.

\subsubsection*{Web API}
The web API module provides the JassTracker services over a REST API.
All framework specific code for handling a request, like loading URL parameters or reading headers, is done here.

\subsubsection*{Data Access}
The data access module is an abstraction layer to the database.
It also encapsulates data migration and other database-specific tasks.
No other module knows the specific database, not even if it's a database at all.
This gives us great flexibility and testability, for example for using an in-memory database if we so desire.
All public services implement by this module are called \emph{Repository} by convention.

\subsubsection*{Domain}
The domain module contains the technology independent business logic.
It handles whose turn it is, calculates advanced statistics, performs extended input validation and so on.
If you wanted to create a fat desktop client for the JassTracker, you would be able to re-use this domain module.

\section{Code}
It is best to illustrate how these components work together by an example.
When a user logs in, he will arrive at an endpoint specified within the web API module.
The web API then proceeds to parse the payload and map it to a call into the domain module.
If the endpoint is authenticated, the current user will be read from the provided JWT header and passed along.

Once in the domain module, business logic happens, other services are called etc.
For example, for a login you'll have to load the player by username from the repository.
The domain doesn't know or care about the exact way a player is found, but it expects a domain player to be returned.
Therefore the repository implementation within the data-access module has to map the database records to the correct domain object.

Once the domain code has decided that the login is valid, a JWT token is created by calling a AuthTokenService.
This service resides within the security module, but the domain doesn't know that.
Thanks to Dependency Injection, the business logic stays completely isolated from technical dependencies.

The token created by the domain is finally returned to the web API, which will ensure the token is returned in a valid JSON to the caller.
If the login had failed, the domain would've return null instead of a valid token.
In that case the web API can decide on how to handle an invalid login, for example by returning a HTTP 400 response.

\section{Deployment Overview}
\label{sec:architecture_deployment}
Our deployment architecture strives for maximum simplicity while remaining flexible and extensible.
To achieve that goal, a few decisions were made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item use a single host to keep it simple
    \item use docker to make deployments portable
    \item use a reverse proxy to enable a separate staging environment
    \item use one database container for all environments to preserve resources
\end{itemize}
