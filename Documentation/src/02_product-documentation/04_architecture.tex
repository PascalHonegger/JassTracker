\chapter{Architecture}

\instructions{
    Describe the architecture of your software as covered in the SEP2 module. The main goal of this chapter is describing the \textbf{technical implementation} in a way that a new team member can start working on the product as fast as possible.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use an existing template as a starting point (\texttt{arc42}, \texttt{C4 model}, ...)
        \item Focus on stable, high-level concepts rather than details
        \item Cover different views (static, dynamic, deployment, ...)
        \item Prefer diagrams over text (ideally UML)
        \item Explain the reasons behind your actions: \textit{Why did we build it like this?}
    \end{itemize}
