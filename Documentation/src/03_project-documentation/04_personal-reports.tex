\section{Team Review}
Generally, whenever we had a question, other members of the team were happy to help and could provide good inputs.
The team was motivated to work on the project and work together to get everything done.
It was very good that we invested extra time in the beginning to setup a good architecture and have clean code, which made it very easy to create new features / endpoints.
There were times, when it was a little challenging, working in a team, because of waiting dependencies, where one had to wait until someone finished something before you could continue working, which caused some delay.
Nevertheless, I'd say we managed very well, especially after noticing this issue and setting internal deadlines during the spring to prevent this, it got much better.
After the large documentation block, we all wanted to start coding, there we didn't truly stick that well to our jira tickets and provided minimal description, which often lead to further questions or having to later change something again.
Pascal dependency was something we could definitely improve on in the future, as he was often the person we contacted to answer questions, give more input on tasks and review our changes.
In the last weeks, we agreed on trying to reduce this dependency with the usage of public chats, asking questions as comments in issues instead of direct messages.
If we'd start the project from new again, we'd definitely invest time into frontend testing, as nearly all our bugs were caused by the frontend, as we don't have any automated testing there.
