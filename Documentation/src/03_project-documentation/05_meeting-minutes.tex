\section{Kickoff Meeting 22.02.2022}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose tools (issue management, time tracking, VCS)
    \item Define and assign roles
    \item Rough long term plan
    \item Finalize vision of project
    \item Define and plan basic meetings
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools}

We plan on using GitLab for everything, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Version control system (Git monorepo)
    \item \href{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/GitLab_Time_Tracking_Tutorial}{Time tracking}
    \item Issue tracking
\end{itemize}

We use MS Teams for internal communication.

\subsection{Roles}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    \textbf{Who} & \textbf{Roles} \\
    \hline
    Pascal & PO, DEV \\
    Marcel & DEVOPS \\
    David  & SM, DEV \\
    Jamie  & QA, DEV
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Way of work}

We will likely use a combination of Scrum+RUP, but haven't decided yet. Will look into it next week.

\subsection{Vision Discussion}

After playing a "Jass" while using the existing Excel worksheet we found the following new features which might be implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Disable input for teams which already played
    \item Add clock to see how long a player has been thinking (maybe not ideal because tracking a "Schiebe" is tedious)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long Term Plan}

Still not clear on how we plan to work, will be discussed next week.
