\subsection{Vision Discussion}

After playing a "Jass" while using the existing Excel worksheet we found the following new features which might be implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Disable input for teams which already played
    \item Add clock to see how long a player has been thinking (maybe not ideal because tracking a "Schiebe" is tedious)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We decided to use GitLab for everything
    \item Assigne basic scrum roles
    \item Play a "Jass", ensure everybody knows basic rules
