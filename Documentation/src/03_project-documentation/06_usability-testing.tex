\section{Initial Usability Testing (Sprint 5)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our first usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 3 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table
    \item Create a new game
    \item Enter round results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daniel Maier
    \item Simon Link 
    \item Jeannette Vieser
    \item Michi Vieser
    \item Marc Honegger
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
Without giving any further instructions, we let the testers explore the application. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table: unclear what a table is, creation easily done and understood
    \item Create new game: easily done and understood
    \item Enter round results: easily done and understood, however confirming the input is not possible with enter
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Numbering the games 
    \item Better visualization of timestamps
    \item Increase scoreboard size for better visibility
\end{itemize}


\section{Usability Testing Round 2 (Sprint 6)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our second usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 5 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new Game (Updated UI Design)
    \item View Help Center
    \item Play as a Guest
    \item Register an Account
    \item Play a whole game
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nadia Bundi
    \item Daniel Maier
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
Without giving any further instructions, we let the testers explore the application. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new Game (Updated UI Design): new UI Design is easier to understand, concerning the teams
    \item View Help Center: Help Center is easy to find and informative
    \item Play as Guest: Playing as guest is harder to find, due to having to click on registration first
    \item Register an Account: easy to understand
    \item Play a whole game: having to explicitly complete a game seems unnecessary
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total for one team, not per person
    \item Copy values from input to team colleagues scoreboard
    \item Being able to switch order of contracts (This is already an extension feature on our roadmap)
    \item Match is not 157 points but 257 points (This is also an extension feature on our roadmap)
\end{itemize}

\section{Final Usability Testing (Sprint 7)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our final usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 4 tasks and all previously mentioned tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item View Game Statistics
    \item View Profile Page
    \item View Player Statistics
    \item Play a whole game
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daniel Maier
    \item Kai Peter
    \item Anja St√∂ckli
    \item Anja Zahner
    \item Nadia Bundi
    \item Stefanie Hollenstein
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
The instructions given were to click on everything that they presumed was clickable and to report anything that didn't make sense to them. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item View Game Statistics: some statistics were not clear at first glance of what they were representing, but with some consideration it made sense. It was also at first not clear that there were table statistics and specific game statistics
    \item View Profile Page: was easily understood and gave no questions
    \item View Player Statistics: easy to find and clear what is displayed 
    \item Play a whole Game:
    \subitem Create Table: It is unclear that the Table name is required, draggable fields are not intuitively understood
    \subitem Enter Scores: Works well with tab or mouse click, extension of entering negative values was not used unless help center was read through carefully beforehand
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tisch erstellen as a button instead of the +
    \item Background should not be white on the table overview (to improve the first impression of the webapp)
    \item Completing a game should require a second confirmation like deleting a game
\end{itemize}
