\section{Initial Usability Testing (Sprint 5)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our first usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 3 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table
    \item Create a new game
    \item Enter round results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
Without giving any further instructions, we let the testers explore the application. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table: unclear what a table is, creation easily done and understood
    \item Create new game: easily done and understood
    \item Enter round results: easily done and understood, however confirming the input is not possible with enter
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Numbering the games 
    \item Better visualization of timestamps
    \item Increase scoreboard size for better visibility
\end{itemize}
