\section{Initial Usability Testing (Sprint 5)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our first usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 3 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table
    \item Create a new game
    \item Enter round results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daniel Maier
    \item Simon Link 
    \item Jeannette Vieser
    \item Michi Vieser
    \item Marc Honegger
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
Without giving any further instructions, we let the testers explore the application. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a table: unclear what a table is, creation easily done and understood
    \item Create new game: easily done and understood
    \item Enter round results: easily done and understood, however confirming the input is not possible with enter
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Numbering the games 
    \item Better visualization of timestamps
    \item Increase scoreboard size for better visibility
\end{itemize}


\section{Usability Testing Round 2 (Sprint 6)}

\subsection{Scope of testing}
For our second usability tests we defined the scope of the test on these 5 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new Game (Updated UI Design)
    \item View Help Center
    \item Play as a Guest
    \item Register an Account
    \item Play a whole game
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nadia Bundi
    \item Daniel Maier
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The testers were presented with our Test environment \url{https://jasstracker-test.honegger.dev/overview}.
Without giving any further instructions, we let the testers explore the application. 

\subsection{Test Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new Game (Updated UI Desing): new UI Design is easier to understand, concerning the teams
    \item View Help Center: Help Center is easy to find and informative
    \item Play as Guest: Playing as guest is harder to find, due to having to click on registration first
    \item Register an Account: easy to understand
    \item Play a whole game: having to explicitley complete a game seems unnecissary
\end{itemize}
Improvement suggestions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total for one team, not per person
    \item Copy values from input to team colleagues scoreboard
    \item Being able to switch order of contracts (This is already an extension feature on our roadmap)
    \item Match is not 157 points but 257 points (This is also an extension feature on our roadmap)
\end{itemize}
