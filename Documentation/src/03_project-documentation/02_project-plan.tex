The following chapters are referencing external tools.
For convenience, those tools are also listed here:

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Processes}

We will use a combination of Scrum (without RUP) because all team members are comfortable with Scrum.
Milestones, iterations and epics are tracked in Jira (see~\ref{sec:TimeAndIssueTracking}).

\subsection*{Meetings}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
    \textbf{Meeting} & \textbf{Schedule} & \textbf{Subject} & \textbf{Timebox} \\
    \hline
    Weekly & Every Saturday & Scrum Daily & 15m \\
    Planning & Every other Tuesday & Scrum Planning & 45m \\
    Retro & Every other Tuesday & Scrum Retrospective & 45m \\
    Review 1 & 07.03.2022 & Project Plan & 1h \\
    Review 2 & 21.03.2022 & Requirements & 1h \\
    Review 3 & 04.04.2022 & End of Elaboration & 1h \\
    Review 4 & 02.05.2022 & Quality & 1h \\
    Review 5 & 23.05.2022 & Architecture & 1h \\
    Presentation & 07.06.2022 & Present the great JassTracker & 30m
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Roles}

Because of the small team size some members have more than one assigned role.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    \textbf{Who} & \textbf{Roles} & \textbf{Responsibilities} \\
    \hline
    Pascal & \makecell{PO, DEV, \\ Architect} & Push project vision, provide business feedback \\
    Marcel & DEVOPS & Setup and maintain operations, continuous delivery \\
    David  & SM, DEV & Ensure correct scrum procedure \\
    Jamie  & QA, DEV & Guarantee the final product has a good quality and works reliably
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{DEV}
A developer is responsible for the development of the target application.
Every developer is responsible for the project / code quality as a whole and should act accordingly.

\subsubsection*{PO}
The product owner is responsible to push the project vision forward.
In planning meetings, he is responsible to get as many features done as possible.
The product backlog is mainly created by the PO, but the team as a whole is responsible for maintaining it.
But the PO has full authority over the prioritization of user stories.

\subsubsection*{DEVOPS}
A devops engineer extends all responsibilities from a regular dev.
In addition, he is responsible for operating the app by ensuring it's working correctly.
He manages and oversees the deployment process and tracks metrics such as uptime or hardware utilization.

\subsubsection*{SM}
The scrum master is responsible for the correct implementation of the scrum process.
He is in charge of organizing the scrum meetings and documenting them if needed (e.g. Retrospective)

\subsubsection*{QA}
Quality Assurance is responsible to ensure a good quality of the final product.
To achieve this, quality metrics should be set up and tracked by QA, such as test coverage.
It is not the responsibility of QA to fix such issues or run manual tests, that honor belongs to the whole team.

\subsubsection*{Architect}
The architect is responsible for architectural decisions regarding the project.
He evaluates and compares different patterns and methodologies to figure out the best fit for the project.
It doesn't mean he's solely responsible for implementing these, but has the lead on them and ensures that the other members are following them correctly.

\section{Collaboration}

We're using MS Teams for internal communication.
We plan on using the \href{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g02-jasstracker/jasstracker}{OST GitLab} for version control.
Changes are always done on separate branches and integrated through merge requests with a required code review.

\section{Risk Management}

\subsection{Very High}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Used technologies are not well knows by all team members (certain, critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation: Every team member should create a PoC in the used technologies to ensure basic understanding is present
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inaccurate estimations (likely and critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: apply cone of uncertainty, apply definition of ready to ensure planning quality
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Poor risk management (likely and critical)  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: likelihood calculation, risk mitigation plans and monitoring of risks every planning
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Project reviewer's expectations are not aligned with project (possible and critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: obtain frequent approval and acknowledgement (naturally happens for us with review meetings)
        \item Mitigated risk: None
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Unexpected absence of team member (unlikely and catastrophic) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: Code changes need to be pushed on a daily basis, stories could at any point be taken over by another team member
        \item Mitigated risk: Medium
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Medium}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Insufficient code quality (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: code reviews, clear coding standards, apply definition of done
        \item Mitigated risk: None
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Lack of ownership (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: setting clear responsibilities for roles
        \item Mitigated risk: None
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Losing sight of documentation tasks (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: documentation strategy, documentation part of definition of done
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Failure of hardware like personal devices, OST GitLab, Jira, hosted environment (rare, catastrophic) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: Code changes need to be pushed on a daily basis
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Low}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project idea, ``Jassen'', is not well known or understood by team members (possible, negligible)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies:  Play a ``Jass'' in the team to ensure everybody knows the basic rules and concepts
        \item Mitigated risk: Low
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Time \& Issue Tracking} \label{sec:TimeAndIssueTracking}

Our project plan is tracked on our \href{https://jasstracker-jira.atlassian.net/browse/JASS}{Jira Board}.
All team members are already experienced with Jira and it provides many desired features (Epics, burndown charts, sprints) which were lacking in GitLab.
