\chapter{Project Plan}

\instructions{
    Describe the project plan as covered in the SEP2 module. A project plan typically consists of the following topics:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Processes, meetings and roles
        \item Phases, iterations and milestones
        \item A \textbf{rough} list of things to be done (work items)
        \item Risk management
        \item Planning Tools (issue tracker, time tracker, ...)
    \end{itemize}
    
    You should \textbf{\underline{not}} describe your \textbf{technical solution} in this chapter. It is all about organizing your project.
}

\section{Relevant Links}

The following chapters are referencing external tools. For convenience, those tools are also listed here:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GitLab: \url{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g02-jasstracker/jasstracker}
    \item Jira: \url{https://jasstracker-jira.atlassian.net/browse/JASS}
\end{itemize}

\section{Processes}

We will use a combination of Scrum+RUP as recommended.
Milestones, iterations and epics are tracked in Jira (see \ref{sec:TimeAndIssueTracking}).

\subsection*{Meetings}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    \textbf{Meeting} & \textbf{Schedule} & \textbf{Subject} \\
    \hline
    Weekly & Every Saturday & Progress and encountered problems \\
    Planning & Every other Saturday & Plan the next sprint, assign stories \\
    Retro & Every other Saturday & Review past spring, how to improve \\
    Review 1 & 07.03.2022 & Project Plan \\
    Review 2 & 21.03.2022 & Requirements \\
    Review 3 & 04.04.2022 & End of Elaboration \\
    Review 4 & 02.05.2022 & Quality \\
    Review 5 & 22.05.2022 & Architecture \\
    Project Presentation & 29.05.2022 & Present JassTracker in its full glory
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Roles}

Because of the small team size some members have more than one assigned role.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    \textbf{Who} & \textbf{Roles} & \textbf{Responsibilities} \\
    \hline
    Pascal & PO, DEV & Push project vision, provide business feedback \\
    Marcel & DEVOPS & Setup and maintain operations, continous delivery \\
    David  & SM, DEV & Ensure correct scrum procedure \\
    Jamie  & QA, DEV & Guarantee the final product has a good quality and works reliably
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Collaboration}

We're using MS Teams for internal communication.
We plan on using the \href{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g02-jasstracker/jasstracker}{OST GitLab} for version control.
Changes are always done on seperate branches and integrated through merge requests with a required code review.

\section{Risk Management}

\subsection{Very High}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Used technologies are not well knows by all team members (certain, critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation: Every team member should create a PoC in the used technologies to ensure basic understanding is present 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Used technologies are not well knows by all team members (certain, critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: Every team member should create a PoC in the used technologies to ensure basic understanding is present 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Inaccurate estimations (likely and critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: apply cone of uncertainty, apply definion of ready to ensure planning quality 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Poor risk management (likely and critical)  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: likelihood calculation, risk mitigation plans and monitoring of risks every planning 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Project reviewer's expectations are not aligned with project (possible and critical) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: obtain frequent approval and acknowledgement (naturally happens for us with review meetings) 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Unexpected absence of team member (unlikely and catastrophic) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: Code changes need to be pushed on a daily basis, stories could at any point be taken over by another team member 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Medium}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Insufficient code quality (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: code reviews, clear coding standards, apply definition of done 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Lack of ownership (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: setting clear responsibilities for roles 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Losing sight of documentation tasks (possible and marginal) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: documentation strategy , documentation part of definiton of done 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Failure of hardware like personal devices, OST GitLab, Jira, hosted environment (rare, catastrophic) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies: Code changes need to be pushed on a daily basis 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Low}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project idea, "Jassen", is not well known or understood by team members (possible, negligible) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigation strategies:  Play a "Jass" in the team to ensure everybody knows the basic rules and concepts 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Time \& Issue Tracking} \label{sec:TimeAndIssueTracking}

Our project plan is tracked on our \href{https://jasstracker-jira.atlassian.net/browse/JASS}{Jira Board}.
All team members are already experienced with Jira and it provides many desired features (Epics, burndown charts, sprints) which were lacking in GitLab.
